					<div class="animated fadeIn" data-delay="1000">
						<p>Regulatory focus on Operational Resilience in the UK has never been higher. Financial institutions must demonstrate stronger, more consistent resilience capabilities, with clear standards set by the FCA and PRA. These expectations are no longer optional — they must be met, maintained, and evidenced.</p>

						<p>Firms within scope of the UK Operational Resilience regulations are required to ensure ongoing compliance, regularly test their resilience, and identify areas for improvement. While these activities should now form part of business-as-usual operations, the regulatory landscape will continue to evolve. Organisations operating across multiple jurisdictions will also need to navigate additional, and sometimes differing, requirements.</p>

						<h2>How We Can Help</h2>
						
						<p>If you're looking for specialist guidance or support with Operational Resilience — whether for a specific change initiative or a broader programme of work — we're here to help. We work closely with clients to understand their needs and develop tailored solutions that add real value. We also help firms build evidence and documentation that can satisfy multiple regulatory regimes without unnecessary duplication.</p>

						<p>Although the UK regulations are primarily aimed at the financial services sector, the underlying principles represent best practice and can be applied effectively across any industry. If you're considering adopting these standards within your organisation, we'd be delighted to discuss how they can be adapted to your environment.</p>

						<h2>Supporting you</h2>

						<p>Operational Risk is woven into every part of your business. It can emerge from any process, activity, system, or interaction — which is why effective management of these risks is fundamental to running a resilient and well controlled organisation. When operational risks are identified early, assessed properly, managed proactively, and reported clearly, businesses are far better equipped to prevent disruption, protect customers, and maintain trust.</p>

						<p>With extensive experience in Operational Risk across financial services and consultancy, we help organisations strengthen their risk capability in a practical and meaningful way. This includes identifying where processes can be enhanced following an incident or breach, improving the design and effectiveness of controls, and supporting the development or uplift of a robust Operational Risk Framework that aligns to regulatory expectations and industry best practice.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="animated fadeIn" data-delay="1000">
						<h2>Identifying risk</h2>
						<p>Our work goes beyond compliance. We help you understand the underlying drivers of operational risk, whether they stem from process weaknesses, control failures, system issues, human error, or external events, and support you in building a more resilient, efficient, and confident organisation.</p>

						<p>Although Operational Risk is often most visible in the banking and finance sector, these risks exist in every industry. Any organisation can be impacted by inadequate processes, technology failures, supplier issues, cyber threats, or unexpected external events and service interruptions. By strengthening your operational risk and resilience capability, you not only reduce the likelihood of incidents but also improve the overall performance and reliability of your business.</p>

				<div class="has-2-columns">
					<div class="animated fadeIn" data-delay="500">
						<p>Now more than ever, organisations need a clear and honest view of their Information and Cyber Security capability. We provide independent assessments of your current maturity, helping you understand where your strengths lie and where critical gaps may expose your business to unnecessary risk.</p>

						<p>Getting this right is essential. When ransomware attacks, data breaches, or unexpected outages occur, the impact can be immediate and severe — from customer disruption and financial loss to longterm reputational damage. By identifying weaknesses early and strengthening your security posture, you can reduce the likelihood of incidents and respond with confidence when challenges arise.</p>

						<p>Our independent perspective gives you the clarity you need to make informed decisions, prioritise investment, and build a more resilient organisation.</p>

						<h3 class="animated fadeInLeft">Strengthening Third Party & Technology Resilience</h3>

						<p>Modern organisations rely heavily on critical third parties, complex technology landscapes, and interconnected systems — and any weakness in these areas can quickly become a major operational risk. We provide independent assessments of your third-party arrangements, technology controls, patching practices, and system resilience to help you understand your true level of exposure.</p>

						<p>Getting this right is essential. Out of date systems, unpatched vulnerabilities, fragile integrations, or weaknesses in supplier oversight can all create pathways for cyber attacks, service outages, and data breaches. When these issues materialise, the impact can be significant: customer disruption, financial loss, regulatory scrutiny, and long lasting reputational damage.</p>

						<p>Our independent perspective helps you identify gaps early, prioritise remediation, and build a stronger, more resilient technology and supplier ecosystem. By addressing these risks proactively, you reduce the likelihood of incidents and ensure your business is better prepared for the unexpected.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="animated fadeIn" data-delay="1000">
						<h3 class="animated fadeInLeft">Training and embedding a risk culture</h3>

						<p>We have extensive experience in delivering operational risk and resilience training that helps teams understand not just how to report risks, but why it matters. By building awareness and confidence, we support organisations in creating a culture where colleagues recognise the value of timely and accurate reporting.</p>

						<p>Our approach helps you and your critical third parties identify the volume and nature of risk events, spot emerging trends, and uncover potential hotspots that may otherwise go unnoticed. We also work with you to foster a no blame environment that encourages open reporting and honest discussion — essential foundations for any effective risk culture.</p>

						<p>When operational risks go unreported, organisations lose the ability to address underlying issues, strengthen their control environment, and prevent repeat incidents. Improving reporting behaviours is therefore one of the most impactful steps a business can take to enhance its overall risk profile and resilience.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="animated fadeIn" data-delay="1500">
						<h3 class="animated fadeInRight">Specialist Support for Change and Transformation Projects</h3>
						<p>We can complement your project and programme teams by providing specialist SME support across risk identification, mitigation, control design, governance, and assurance. Our expertise helps ensure that risks are understood early, managed effectively, and embedded into the delivery lifecycle rather than addressed reactively.</p>

						<p>We work closely with programme leads to interpret internal policies and navigate the complexities of external regulation — including Data Protection and GDPR, as well as the Critical Third-Party regime and the linked requirements captured within DORA. This ensures that change activity is delivered safely, with full awareness of regulatory expectations and without unintended breaches or reportable events. This is especially important for programmes handling large volumes of personal or sensitive data, or where new suppliers are introduced to the existing technology environment, where the consequences of missteps can be significant.</p>

						<p>Our goal is to strengthen your delivery capability, reduce risk exposure, and give you confidence that your change initiatives are compliant, well controlled, and aligned to best practice.</p>
